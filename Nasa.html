            When a city’s name is one of the first words spoken on the surface of another world, the link between that city and NASA through its Johnson Space Center is rather obvious. And as the site of the memorable vista of Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and shuttle launches, Florida’s Space Coast has a clear connection to NASA and its Kennedy Space Center as well.

But when many people think about NASA, places like Moffett Field or Hancock County, Miss., may not immediately come to mind. Yet these locations are also home to vital parts of NASA.

Spread out from coast to coast, NASA’s centers and facilities are as diverse as the many different elements of the agency’s missions. That’s no coincidence – each location is home to different areas of expertise, supporting different elements of those missions.

Today, for example, Stennis Space Center in Mississippi is conducting rocket engine testing in support of NASA’s exploration mission. At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, scientists are reviewing information being sent back to Earth from distant reaches of the solar system, supporting the space science mission. Expertise in supercomputing and the search for life beyond Earth is a hallmark of the Ames Research Center in California. Satellites managed by Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland provide atmospheric data vital to NASA’s Earth science research. Ideas for advanced space propulsion are tested at the Glenn Research Center in Ohio. Langley Research Center in Virginia, America’s first civilian aeronautics research laboratory, plays a key role in space transportation for small payloads and satellites. The Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama develops rockets, spacecraft and instruments for space exploration and scientific discovery. And new remotely piloted aircraft recently delivered to Dryden Flight Research Center in California will not only support the aeronautics research mission, but will also serve as scientific research platforms.

NASA’s 10 major centers, plus its headquarters in Washington, D.C., are joined by eight smaller facilities -- Goddard Institute for Space Studies (New York City), Independent Verification & Validation Facility (West Virginia), Michoud Assembly Facility (New Orleans), NASA Shared Services Center (Mississippi), Plum Brook Station (Ohio), Wallops Flight Facility (Virginia), White Sands Test Facility (New Mexico) and Dryden Aircraft Operations Facility (California).

As NASA undertakes the monumental task of returning humans to the moon and then exploring farther into the solar system, the agency will draw from all of these diverse areas of expertise. Every one of NASA’s centers has been assigned duties in the development of the new architecture that will return humans to the moon. Each center also has a vital task relating to establishing a productive ongoing presence there once that return is accomplished.

An exciting future awaits, and it will take all of NASA, working together, to make it happen.

NASA Headquarters (Washington, D.C.)
NASA Headquarters, located a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol building, is the leadership nerve center for the agency’s activities.

Headquarters management has steered U.S. civil space and aeronautics policy throughout the agency’s history, setting in motion some of the most far-reaching and history-making events in the Space Age. First located in the Dolly Madison House a stone’s throw from the White House, NASA Headquarters has seen its share of history, including visits from Presidents Lyndon Johnson, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. In popular literature, the current headquarters building is the setting for intrigue in Dan Brown’s novel “Deception Point.”

Under the agency’s first two administrators, T. Keith Glennan and James E. Webb, the headquarters leadership team made the critical decisions to move forward quickly on America’s man in space program and then assemble the massive government-industry-university partnership required for the Apollo Program. At headquarters, NASA’s leaders also participated in the government’s decision to allow NASA’s activities, including its successes and failures, to be broadcast in real time. This commitment fit with the mandate of the 1958 Space Act for the agency to “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof.”

Under Webb’s leadership, headquarters staff members helped draft the 1967 United Nations Treaty on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and dealt forthrightly with addressing the agency’s failings after the tragic Apollo 1 fire.

As NASA was recovering from the Apollo 1 tragedy, the Central Intelligence Agency told agency officials in August 1968 that the Soviet Union might be preparing for a manned lunar flyby mission. These reports prompted bold action. NASA managers from around the country met at headquarters to consider sending the second Apollo flight around the moon. Apollo 8 (Dec. 1968) marked the first time astronauts rode aboard the Saturn V, as well as the first time humans ever left Earth orbit. The mission was a huge success and global sensation, leading the way for the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission of July 1969.

As the 1970s began, a new relationship was forged between the two space powers when NASA officials, led by George Low, negotiated an agreement with their Soviet counterparts to conduct the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in July 1975. More recently, years of patient negotiations directed by Headquarters’ External Affairs office has led to the 15-nation International Space Station partnership. These negotiations and subsequent efforts to manage the partnership have carefully defined each partner’s contributions and responsibilities, established useful technical compatibility standards, and built a foundation for future international space cooperation.

On Jan. 14, 2004, NASA Headquarters was the site of an announcement that established an exciting new direction for space exploration for decades to come. That day, President George W. Bush spoke in the Headquarters’ James Webb auditorium and proposed that NASA adopt the new goals of returning humans to the moon, this time to stay for months at a time, and eventually to send pioneering explorers to Mars and beyond. Charged with implementing these objectives is the NASA Headquarters’ leadership team, headed by Administrator Dr. Michael D. Griffin. NASA’s 11th administrator, Griffin previously served the agency as chief engineer and associate administrator for Exploration. More recently, he was Space Department Head at Johns Hopkins University’s Applied Physics Laboratory.

NASA’s Deputy Administrator is Shana Dale, who oversees the day-to-day work of NASA’s functional offices, such as the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of General Counsel, and Strategic Communications. Before coming to NASA, Dale was deputy director for Homeland and National Security for the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy. NASA’s Associate Administrator is Chris Scolese, formerly the agency’s chief engineer.

NASA Headquarters is organized into four Mission Directorates: Aeronautics Research (Associate Administrator Dr. Jaiwon Shin), Exploration Systems (AA Dr. Richard J. Gilbrech), Science (AA Dr. Alan Stern) and Space Operations (AA William Gerstenmaier). These officials have direct oversight of field center performance in implementing NASA policies and programs.

In order to effectively carry out the nation’s civil aeronautics and space policies, headquarters maintains close relationships with the White House and other Executive Branch offices (e.g. Office of Science and Technology Policy and Office of Management and Budget). Headquarters through its Office of External Relations also works regularly with other U.S. government agencies such as the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State, and Transportation. The headquarters’ Legislative Affairs staff interfaces with members of Congress and their staffs, the 50 state governors and other local officials. The headquarters’ Education team works with museums, universities and K-12 schools to promote excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education. Press briefings and media information requests are handled by the headquarters Public Affairs staff.
