            <p>
                The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is an independent agency of the U.S. federal government responsible for the civil space program, aeronautics research, and space research.

               NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), to give the U.S. space development effort a distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing peaceful applications in space science.
               NASA has since led most American space exploration, including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the 1968-1972 Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle. NASA supports the International Space Station and oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for the crewed lunar Artemis program, Commercial Crew spacecraft, and the planned Lunar Gateway space station. The agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.

           <h3>UNIVERSE</h3>
           <p>
            Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of a few hundred billion stars in the Milky Way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the universe. Many of the stars in a galaxy have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure.[14] Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and that space has been expanding since then at an increasing rate.

            <h3>BLACKHOLE</h3>
            <p>
                A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon.[2] The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.[3][4] The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.

                Today started off with the news that yestersol plan did not fully complete. There was an issue in the set of planned SAM activities that resulted in those activities not completing. While we diagnose the issue, we are taking a break from drill activities and filling the plan with lots of remote science.

Part of the plan will include retaking observations that did not complete on sol 2537. This includes ChemCam LIBS observations of “Peeblesshire,” “Perthshire,” and the offset from the “Glen Etive 1” dump pile. Peeblesshire and Perthshire are both pebbles near the drill site.

Additionally, the plan includes a ChemCam LIBS observation and a corresponding Mastcam image of “Stove,” which is a target located between the two drill locations. There will also be a Mastcam mosaic of Mt. Sharp that will be taken late in the day to test what the best time of day is for these observations. “Stony Side” is a ChemCam RMI mosaic that is pointed back towards Vera Rubin ridge to capture an outcrop that is along the edge of the ridge.

There will also be a dust devil movie, a supra-horizon movie for cloud monitoring, a line-of-sight observation, and a cloud altitude observation. Several Mastcam observations are included to estimate the amount of dust in the atmosphere: a tau observation and a crater rim extinction observation. There will also be a phase function sky survey, which is used to measure the angular scattering of light by clouds. Observations such as this one help us to constrain the shape of the ice crystals in the clouds.

Finally, today plan includes ChemCam RMI sky flats. This is a routine observation to check for dust on the ChemCam optical window.

Hopefully this will be a brief intermission and we will be back to drill analysis activities in the weekend plan!

             Orion is a space capsule larger than the Apollo command modules that are designed to carry four astronauts on missions to the moon. NASA successfully launched Artemis 1 at 01:47 a.m. EST (0647 GMT) on November 16, from Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
             The Artemis program is a renaming of several earlier activities NASA was already undertaking to return humans to the moon. These were mandated by President Trump's Space Policy Directive 1, which tasked the agency with focusing on missions to the moon. In 2019, vice president Mike Pence set an ambitious deadline to land humans at the lunar south pole by 2024. 
             Perhaps the most ambitious of the Artemis mission's objectives involves using the moon as a stepping stone for a mission to Mars. Robots have done all the detective work on Mars so far, but NASA now aims to send astronauts there by the 2030s. With a future target set on the Red Planet, the return to the moon will be used to provide us with the knowledge and tools to better navigate our solar system. But how can the moon help prepare us for a mission to Mars, an entirely different and more unpredictable mission?
             Three-time NASA astronaut Steven Swanson– who has logged over 195 days in space during three missions to the International Space Station (aboard Space Shuttle flights STS-117 and STS-119 and Soyuz flight TMA-12M)– spoke about the significance of Artemis with Space.com's sister publication How It Works magazine. 
             "The real goal is Mars. And we will use the moon as a testbed because Mars is a very difficult mission", Swanson said in the November 2020 issue. "It's going to take almost three years, and you can’t come home early on a Mars mission. It's a seven or eight-month journey to get there and you have to wait 15 months there.
             Between 1969 and 1972, six missions took place in which 12 people walked on the surface of the moon — all of them men. For such a high-risk mission, the most experienced astronauts were required, and at the time there were no women at NASA who had suitable test flight experience. For a long time, space was viewed as an industry primarily for men, and it wasn't until 1978 that NASA selected its first female astronauts. As of March 2022, 75 women have been to space, and the Artemis moon landing will serve as a reminder of changing times.
             At the center of the Artemis program are NASA's new megarocket, the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion spacecraft. The SLS is a 322-foot-tall (98 meters) rocket consisting of a core stage, upper stage and twin five-segment solid rocket boosters to launch a payload into space. For crewed Artemis missions, the rocket will launch the Orion spacecraft to the moon. Orion is a space capsule larger than the Apollo command modules that are designed to carry four astronauts on missions to the moon.
             NASA successfully launched Artemis 1 at 01:47 a.m. EST (0647 GMT) on November 16, from Launch Complex 39B at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida
             The first mission was uncrewed to test the safety of the SLS rocket, and the Orion capsule's ability to reach the moon, perform in lunar orbit and return to Earth for an ocean splashdown. The SLS rocket carried 10 cubesats into space to perform experiments and technology demonstrations. 
             The Orion capsule splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Baja California on Dec. 11, bringing a successful end to NASA's historic Artemis 1 moon mission after a 1.4 million-mile (2.3 million kilometers) flight.             
             Carrying the first four Artemis astronauts, the Orion capsule will take the crew farther from Earth than humans have ever traveled before. Over the approximately 10-day mission, the crew will complete a lunar flyby and return to Earth, evaluating the spacecraft's systems while carrying humans.
             This will see the next man and first woman step onto the lunar surface. Providing previous missions have been successful, the astronauts will shoot towards the moon, using the lunar lander to lower two people to the moon's south polar region. They will remain on the moon for around a wee
